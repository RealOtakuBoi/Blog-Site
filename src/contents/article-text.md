### Title: Principles of Reduce, Reuse, Recycle in Plastic Waste Management

### It makes a big difference to recycle. It makes a big difference to use recycled products. It makes a big difference to reuse things, to not use the paper cup - and each time you do, that's a victory.

### - Emily Deschanel

This simple quote by a wonderful actress Emily Deschanel explains Recycling, Reducing, and Reusing quite simply. In these days of Technology, one thing has become a part of our life which is very common but very harmful, we use it every day when buying something new or dispose of something old. For these everyday activities, we use plastic and being more precisely polythene bags made up of plastic. On the surface, it doesn't seem very deadly but in the grand scheme of things, it is one of the most harmful things for the environment if not the most harmful. Plastic is very harmful for it is non-biodegradable. This means that waste plastic cannot be turned into any other substance that is eco-friendly. Although tonnes and tonnes of plastic are burned in the most advanced incinerators, all that remains in plastic. It doesn't change into anything else, as many other materials do. Hence plastic waste is dangerous to the environment Not Being Biodegradable is one of the worst flaws as when it reaches the drainage system and this causes clogging Plastic carry bags reach the drainage system and this causes clogging especially during the rains. If too much plastic ends up in a lake or a pond, it creates a layer that denies oxygen to everything below so that no plant or animal life can survive in that water body. If animals eat plastic bags thrown in rubbish dumps, it knots up their intestines and they die painful deaths. If plastic lies on land, it can choke it to the extent that nothing will grow there again. The main cause of this is the mass production of plastic, plastic is being produced because people are using it too much. Now here the 3R(s) come into play. Recycling takes 88% less energy than making plastic from crude materials while helping lessening petroleum derivative utilization; Redirecting disposed of plastics from the reject stream and transforming them into new products keeps these steady materials out of landfills and the natural environment. This way Recycling helps Plastic Waste management, as throwing away plastic would give birth to these problems so recycling plastic prevents this from happening and can help in creative work. As said in the quote by Emily Deschanel Reusing also makes a huge difference. Reusing helps in this too, most of the problems are caused by throwing away the plastic but instead of throwing it away if we use it every time we need a plastic bag we can reduce the waste by 40%. And the most straightforward solution to this problem is the third R, Reducing if we reduce our use of plastic is going to be the biggest help. For The future generation, we should try to follow the principles of 3R(s) so that we can make a better world for the future generations.
