## Motivation

I've been always thinking about launching my own website with my custom domain name (**satnaing.dev**) since my college student life. But that never happened until this project. I've done several projects and works about web application development but I didn't make an effort to do this.

So, "what about blog?" you may ask. Yeah, blog also has been in my project list for some time. I always wanted to make a blog project using some of the latest technologies. However, I've been busy with my works and other projects so that blog project has never been started.

In these days, I tend to develop my own projects with the focus in good quality rather than quantity. After the project is done, I usually put a proper readme file in the Github repo. But Github repo readme is only suitable for technical aspects (this is just my thought). I want to write down my experiences and challenges. Thus, I decided to make my own blog. Plus, at this point, I have decent experiences and confidence to develop this project.
