# How Maths is used in Cryptocurrencies ?

Proof of work is a concept used in many cryptocurrencies, including Bitcoin, to ensure the integrity of the blockchain. It is a way of reaching consensus among a decentralized network of computers, without the need for a central authority.  
  
In a proof of work system, computers on the network compete to solve a difficult mathematical problem. The first one to solve the problem gets to add a new block of transactions to the blockchain, and is rewarded with some units of the cryptocurrency. This process is known as mining.  
  
The mathematical problem that needs to be solved is carefully designed to be difficult, but easy to verify. It requires a lot of computational power to solve, which is why it is called "proof of work." It's called "proof" because it proves that a lot of work went into solving the problem.  
  
The use of proof of work has several benefits. It makes it very difficult for anyone to tamper with the blockchain, because doing so would require re-mining all the blocks that came after the tampered one. This would require a tremendous amount of computational power, and would be prohibitively expensive.  
  
Proof of work also ensures that new blocks are added to the blockchain at a consistent rate. Since the mathematical problem becomes more difficult over time, the rate at which new blocks are added slows down. This prevents the blockchain from growing too quickly, and ensures that all the computers on the network have a fair chance to compete for the reward.  
  
In conclusion, proof of work is a clever way of ensuring the integrity and security of a decentralized network. It is used by many cryptocurrencies, and has proven to be effective in practice.
